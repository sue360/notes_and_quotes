ReadMe - GA Project Four: Full stack app - 4-7 days

Description

I created this web app as my fourth project for General Assembly’s software engineering immersive course. The brief was to build a full stack application with CRUD functionality, integrating learning from the final two weeks of the course, including JavaScript/REACT, Bootstrap, and more. This included creating an API, which seeded information to the site, and designing a front end interface with a well thought out user journey.

This was a solo project, and I worked independently over seven days. True build time turned out to be shorter (four days), due to a technical issue with my machine early on. Building this app allowed me to gain experience working independently on a full stack application with Django databases, Python and many other technologies, which I will detail below. I will discuss the process, results, and key takeaways below too.

Timeframe & Working Team

I worked alone, and spent four days building this project (due to time lost after a technical issue on my machine).

Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6)
HTML5
CSS3
React.js
Django
Axios
Git
GitHub
Insomnia
TablePlus



Brief

The project brief set out necessary features the final app needed to include to serve as a minimum viable product (MVP).

I’ve included the brief below:

 **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
 

Planning

Due to the tight deadline and the complexity of technologies involved, which were still very new to me at the time, planning was pivotal. I made use of a trello board to manage specific tasks during the build phase and used a google doc for high level planning and

jotting down ideas. I used Excalidraw to create wireframes too, to ensure that I had a clear idea of what each page would require before I started building, and to plan out how the site would look. This was important for streamlining the site’s aesthetic, and for managing my own ambitions, as working alone meant that I had to be more deliberate in balancing possibility with feasibility, and at times reign in more expansive ideas for the app and focus on what might be achievable. I’ve included an image above. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I made use of GitHub for version control and backup. This

proved useful when I encountered technical difficulties - I might have lost more work (and time) had I not set up and pushed to GitHub from early on.


Build

I started by setting up the backend. I anticipated that this would be the most challenging part of the build, as I had more experience with the technologies that would be required for the front end. For the backend, I used a Django framework and Python to set up routes for users to add, delete and update text (‘notes’). I tested each route using Insomnia, which took longer than I had hoped, due to small bugs and syntax errors, such as in the screenshot below.
